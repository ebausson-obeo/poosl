== Data structures

* https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/libraries/Matrix.poosl[Matrix]

* https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/libraries/StateMachine.poosl[StateMachine]

* https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/libraries/Vector.poosl[Vector] of real numbers with basic linear algebra. Some https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/tests/VectorTest.poosl[Vector tests] are available to test the functionality.

== External interaction

* Co-simulation via https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/libraries/JsonRPC.poosl[JSON-RPC], including https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/examples/JsonRPCExample[JSON-RPC examples] that demonstrate how POOSL models can interact with Java and Python code.

* https://github.com/eclipse/poosl/tree/main/docs/samples/org.eclipse.poosl.user-contributions/libraries/XmlWriter.poosl[XmlWriter] to create text in XML format.
